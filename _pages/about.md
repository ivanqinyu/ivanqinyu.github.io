Greetings,

I'm a software engineer based in Bristol, United Kingdom, deeply passionate about software development, algorithm, artificial intelligence, and financial quantitative trading.

I completed my undergraduate and postgraduate studies in Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Bristol.

In my spare time, I enjoy travelling and vlogging. 
Apart from that, I enjoy playing card games, Rubik's Cube and board games to relax.

I'm always eager to connect and share ideas, so please feel free to contact me via email.

<br/>
