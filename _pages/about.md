Greetings,

I'm a software engineer based in Bristol, United Kingdom, deeply passionate about software development, artificial intelligence, and the fascinating realm of financial quantitative trading.

I completed my undergraduate and postgraduate studies in Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Bristol, specializing in algorithms and artificial intelligence.

When I'm not immersed in code, I love exploring new destinations through travel and unwinding with board games.

I'm always eager to connect and share thoughts, so please don't hesitate to get in touch via email.
