Hi! I'm a fourth year Master Engineer student doing the **Computer Science and Mathematics** at **University of Bristol**.

My main research interests lie in Algorithms and Data Structures, Data Streaming algorithm and Deep Learning.

I am currently looking for a relative Ph.D. or a job opportunity.
