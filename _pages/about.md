Greetings,

I am a PhD student at the University of Liverpool, where I research Fairness and Diversity in Graph Algorithms.

I completed my undergraduate and postgraduate studies in Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Bristol.

Outside of academia, I’m passionate about travel and photography.

I enjoy exchanging ideas and welcome you to get in touch with me via email at any time.
