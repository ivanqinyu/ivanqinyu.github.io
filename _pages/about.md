Greetings,

I'm a software engineer based in Bristol, United Kingdom, deeply passionate about software development, algorithm, artificial intelligence, and financial quantitative trading.

I completed my undergraduate and postgraduate studies in Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Bristol.

When I have free time, I enjoy traveling and capturing moments through vlogging.
In addition to that, I like to unwind by playing card games, rubik's cube and board games.

I'm always eager to connect and share thoughts, so please don't hesitate to get in touch via email.

<br/>
