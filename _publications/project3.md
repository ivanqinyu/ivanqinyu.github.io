This paper is finished by myself, and supervised by Prof. Francesco Mezzadri. It is the Year-3 Mathematics thesis.

It discussed the mathematics nature (Group theory) of the rubik's cube, and compare many computer algorithms for solving Rubik's cube. 
Moreover, it researched on the state-of-art deep learning solving algorithm.
